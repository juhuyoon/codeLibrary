    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); //100, 100
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // 200, 100 because age goes into age2 up top as a variable.


    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team); //same array.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'; //for players, the change occurs as well. 
    //this happens as when you update this new array, it changes back the original array. 
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!


    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
   
    //create a new array and concat the old one in OR slice the players array.

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Jenny';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed


    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
            // const captain = person;
            // captain.number = 99 
    //this will change the person's number age as well. 

    // how do we take a copy instead?
        const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99})
        console.log(cap2);


    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
        const cap3 = {...person};
        //seen often in react!


    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
        const wes = {
            name: 'Wes', 
            age: 100,
            social: {
                twitter : '@wes',
                facebook: 'wes'
            }
        }

        console.log(wes);

        //to make a copy of wes
            const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
            dev.name = 'wesley';

        //but...
            dev.social.twitter = '@somethingelse'
            //look at console.log(wes.social) and see that twitter changec here!
            //look for function: cloneDeep
