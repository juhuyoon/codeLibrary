//lexical logic of thinking process. 

  // ---------- OLD Methods (no arrow function)
  
  // compare to old methods, where new functions built their own scope
  function Person() {
    var that = this; //'this' must be referenced to 'that' in order to have the 'that.age' to be recognized in the setInterval. 
    that.age = 0;
  
    setInterval(function() {
      // have to store |this| to a new variable at the higher scope
      that.age++;
    }, 1000);
  }

  // or other old method:
  function Person() {
    this.age = 0;
  
    setInterval(function() {
      this.age++;
      // bind this function's 'this' value to current scope's 'this'
    }.bind(this), 1000);
  }
  
///////HOW TO USE ARROW FUNCTION TO SOLVE IT!///////////////

function Person() {
    this.age = 0;
  
    setInterval(() => { //the arrow function allows you to get past the need to have scoping issues!
      this.age++; // |this| is parent's context - properly refers to the person object
    }, 1000);
