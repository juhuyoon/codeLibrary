  let inRing = 'Hulk Hogan';
  let onSide = 'The Rock';

  //past way to switch out the variables:
  var temp = inRing;
  inRing = onSide;
  onSide = temp;
  //then remove temp. 

  //with destructuring, you can just swap this and not have to do the old way anymore. 
  console.log(inRing, onSide);
  [inRing, onSide] = [onSide, inRing]; //easy swap ways. 
  console.log(inRing, onSide);
