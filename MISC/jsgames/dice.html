            <p>- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.</p>
            <p> - In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score.</p>
            <p> - BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.</p>
            <p> - The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that,
                it's the next player's turn.</p>
            <p> - The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.</p>
