# CodeLibrary

As people step into the world of coding, often times, there are random scenarios and problems that people run into that leave people befuddled. 

The hope with this code library is to be a place to find generic codes, strange logic problems, and quick explanations for new languages that people can use to read, learn, and use!

### Folders
Javascript 
1) Key differences between ES5 and ES6 [ES6.js](https://github.com/juhuyoon/codeLibrary/blob/master/ES6_logic.js)
2) Javascript conundrums and Gotcha codes filled with the best puns [JS-Gotcha.js](https://github.com/juhuyoon/codeLibrary/blob/master/JS-Gotchas.js)

React
1)  [concepts.js](https://github.com/juhuyoon/codeLibrary/blob/master/React/concepts.js) Work in Progress
2) Create React App How to Library [createreactapp.md](https://github.com/juhuyoon/codeLibrary/blob/master/React/createreactapp.md)

Random Files 
1) Random generic functions that you can pull out and use for various scenarios (I) 
[Randomfunc.js](https://github.com/juhuyoon/codeLibrary/blob/master/Randomfunc.js)
2) A logic JS that I ran into, hopefully adding more [logic.js](https://github.com/juhuyoon/codeLibrary/blob/master/logic.js)
3) A collection of useful console. dev tools that can be used organized on an html file [consoledevtools.html](https://github.com/juhuyoon/codeLibrary/blob/master/consoledevtools.html)
