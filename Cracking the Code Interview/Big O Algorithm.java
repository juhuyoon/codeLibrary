Big O time = language and metric used to describe the efficiency of algorithms. 

Time complexity: Asymptotic runtime / big O time. 
    Data transfer Algorithm runtime is:
        1) Electronic Transfer: O(s), s = size of the file. Time to transfer the file increases linearly with the size of the file. 
        2) Airplane Transfer: O(1) with respect to size of the file. As the size increases, will not take any longer to get the file to your friend. Time is constant.
