When dealing with a student one on one, it’s easy to tell the student what to type to fix their issue(s). However, that’s not the best way to get your student(s) to learn how to solve problems. Instead, you should guide your students to the answer, and not tell them the answer.

On the flip side, if there are fundamental issues with how a student is working, then directly help the student overcome them first. We want to help them understand shortcuts make a big difference over the many hours of coding.

Examples of fundamental issues
Indentation - much easier to see all your code!
Open a folder, not a file! File structure is important to remember when coding!
Using explorer folder view to open & create files instead of terminal or sublime.

Throughout your time tutoring, you’ll find that sometimes you know the answer, and sometimes you don’t.

When you don’t, it’s best to remind the student no need to memorize, get good at googling! Let them take the lead, and help them as needed.

If you do see the problem, help the student identify it, and lead them to the resources they need to try to fix it on their own.

If you find yourself having trouble not giving the answer to students, check this out. It’s chock full of ideas!

To prep for a 1:1, learn about the student.
Student grades average & above
Help lead them there - but try to help them learn on their own next time.
Student has below average grades, but attends class & turns in assignments
This type of student is going to need more hand holding at first, but we don’t want to stunt their growth - try to find a balance between explaining core concepts again so they can grasp, and helping them learn to google things they don’t understand on their own.
Student misses classes & assignments often
Talk to your student success manager about how to proceed with that student. 
What if everyone is having the same problem...
We respect your time - if there are many students that are having an issue, and approach you for 1:1s - feel free to schedule a group session instead.

Helping out in the classroom!
Use stronger, helpful students to your advantage if it makes sense - as I’m sure you already know, teaching someone else can really help solidify the learning process. Frame it as them doing you a favor - but don’t feel guilty, you’re still doing your job!

Helping out on slack!
If it’s a problem with the code, you can troubleshoot with them via slack the same way you do in class. Just ask them to commit to github and send you the link - that way you have the whole picture to look at.

If it’s a conceptual problem, direct the students to a resource. You can recommend a video, tutorial, stackoverflow article, or a previous class activity solution - whatever you think will help them jump that hurdle.
 
If the student is still having issues, you may want to schedule a hangouts with the student. Remember to set expectations that you only have a few minutes to chat, but are happy to go over the basics of whatever fundamental concept they need some clarity on.
Work asynchronously
Always give them a step to take, and ask them to follow-up if they have any additional questions. Many students will figure it out and just send you a thank you - your job is complete.
Help! Student isn’t responding!
Don’t sweat it. Help out if you can, and not if you can’t. Just do your student success manager a favor and mention it.

// How to not give it away!

If you need to look up the answer
You can tell the student:
“There are literally hundreds of thousands of things a developer could use. You’re never going to memorize all of them. Instead, you get good at knowing what to look up. Additionally, good developers keep their past code organized, so they can easily reference it in the future.”

“Ok open up Google. What do you think we should write for the search query?”
If student is wrong, you can ask the student to be more specific or to describe the exact problem.

Upon seeing the search results, guide the student to where the answer would be

After finding the answer, ask the student if he/she kind of understands it
Yes - “Great! I want you to spend 15 minutes implementing this. I’ll check back with you after that to see your progress.”
No - Guide the student to what the answer does - point to parts of code and ask the student what that part of the code might be doing until you’ve dissected it all together.

If you don’t need to look up the answer 
Javascript:
Ask the student to open the console. If there are errors, ask the student to identify any errors and go to those lines of code

If you identify any errors on the page, ask the student to identify the error(s) on the specific line(s).
Student is correct - congratulate them, ask them to explain further if needed to make sure the understand.
Student is incorrect or cannot identify the error - direct them to resources to read more about the concept, or give your own explanation of how it works. Then ask them to try their best to fix it for 15 minutes, and you’ll come check.
CSS:
Ask the student to inspect the element causing the issue. If issue with flow, have them inspect the surrounding elements as well. Do they see anything wrong on these styles listed for these elements?
Yes: Tell the student to try typing the change into the inspector that they think should fix it, if it still isn’t behaving as expected, look up that property - is it supposed to do that? Is there a better property for that?
No: Tell the student to explain what they want the element to do, and help them formulate a google search query - remind them there are a million different options in CSS, and there might be a better property for this they haven’t discovered yet!
HTML:
Point the student to the w3 validator https://validator.w3.org/ - ask them to spend 15 minutes fixing the errors that this validator popped out - you’ll check on them shortly!

Help! I can’t find the answer!
Don’t be afraid to ask for help from other students, TAs, and the teacher. We’re all in this together! It’ll help the student understand an error is a process, and it sometimes takes longer to solve even for a more experienced programmer.

Example interaction:
Student: “Help!”
TA: “So in 1 short sentence what’s the biggest problem your page/code/feature is having?“

Student: “Actually, there’s 2: my sublime text isn’t coloring any of the text right, and I can’t figure out how to format my jQuery click!”

TA: “Hmm. I would say let’s tackle the sublime text coloring first. Does sublime know what type of file this is?”

Student: “Oooh… it says plain text down there, thanks! I feel dumb”

TA: “Not at all - I still do that sometimes! Now, let’s start on that click function. What have you tried so far?”

Student: “Actually… nothing, I was just trying to get it from memory.”


TA: “You know the best place to start - google!”

*Student google jquery click, starts to solve their own problem*

Student: “Oh man, I see where I was going wrong, thanks for the help!”
