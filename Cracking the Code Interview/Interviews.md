What to Expect from Coding/Technical Interviews:

Assessment of interview performance:
 [Interviewers assess you relative to other candidates on that same question by the same interviewer]
    1) Analytical Skills   
        - Did you need help solving the problem
        - How optimal was your solution/How long did it take to solve    it
        - Did you structure the problem well and that you thought of     different tradeoffs of solutions?

    2) Coding Skills
        - Did you translate your algorithm to reasonable code?
        - Clean and well organized
        - Good style

    3) Technical knowledge/Computer Science Fundamentals
        - Strong foundation in computer science/relevant technologies

    4) Experience
        - Good technical decisions in the past 
        - Build interesting challenging projects

    5) Culture Fit/ Communication Skills
        - Personality/values fit from the company and team
        - Did you communicate well with the interviewer

Prepare for False Negatives:
    Companies are ok with rejecting good candidates as they don't want people who do well in interviews but are not very good at the actual coding/job. 

Problem Solving Skills, basic data structure/algorithm knowledges are VERY useful!

** Note, even 'screening' initial interviews can involve coding/algorithm questions, so ask your recruiter what position your interviewer holds! If the interviewer is an engineer, he/she will usually perform a technical interview **


After the technical interviews, follow up with the recruiter if there is no decision after a week. 

*** Microsoft Interview ***
    Typical Interview is: Show up in the morning and fill out paperwork
                            -Get asked questions (basic technical questions) by the recruiter as he/she may want to ease you in.
                            -Be friendly with your recruiter as he/she may or may not push you for a re-interview if you need it.
                            -During the day, you'll do 4 - 5 interviews with two different teams. 
                            -If you talk with the hiring manager afterwards(app), then most likely you passed the technical interview. 
                            
                Definitely prepare: "why do you want to work for microsoft?"
                        Possible Answer: "I've been using Microsoft software as long as I can remember, and I'm really impressed at how Microsoft manages to create a product that is universally excellent!:

*** Amazon Interview ***
    Typical Interview is: Phone screen where the candidate interviews with a specific team. 
                           - Most likely two or more interviews, which means either the interviewer wasn't convinced or the candidates are being considered for a different team. 
                           - Engineer who interviews will asjk simple code via shared document editor. 
                           - Fly to Seattle and go through 4 or 5 interviews with one to two teams based on resume and phone interview. Code on a whiteboard and interviewers will stress other skills. 
                           -Then meet with 'Bar raiser" interviewer who ask significantly more difficult questions to raise the bar. Must impress both the bar-raiser AND the hiring manager.

*** Google Interview *** 
    Typical Interview is: Google engineer performs first phone screen (so expect technical questions) via coding/shared                     document

                        -On site interview: 4 to 6 people, one with a lunch interviewer.

                        - To be hired, wants at least one interviewer who is an 'enthusiastic endorser'.    
                                [Scores of 3.6, 3.1, 3.1, 2.6 is better than a score of all 3.1s]
                        -Offer is measured from the scores you got, and decision can take up to several weeks. 

                Definitely Prepare: Scalable systems, strong focus on analytical skills. 

*** Apple Interview ***
