REDUX FLOW:

{type: RATE_COURSE, rating: 5}
Action  ==>   Store ===> <== Reducers
                ==> React

= Action describes a user's intent, a plain function
= Requires a type property

rateCourse(rating) {
    return {type: RATE_COURSE, rating: rating} <--- the action itself
}



Function that returns a new state based on the action
= Reducers function appReducer(state = defaultState, action) {
    sweitch(action.type){
         case(RATE_COURSE) 
         == Return Some data
 }
 }

Once new state is returned from reducer, state is updated, then notifies React via React-Redux library
