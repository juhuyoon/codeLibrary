//1) Everything is an Object
//2) A program is a bunch of objects telling each other what to do by sending messages.
//3) Each object has its own memory made up of other objects. 
//4) Every object has a type.
//5) All objects of a particular type can receive the same messages.

//Class: Creating abstract data typpes is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming. 
//Since a class describes a set of objects, a class is really a data type. 
    //Once a class is established, can make as many objects of that class as you like and then manipulate those objects. 
    //A major challenge of object-oriented programming is to create a one-to-one mapping between elements int he problem space and objects in the solution space. 

    //To make an object useful, requests must be made and these are defined by an interface. 
    //Interface determines the requests that you can make for a particular object. 

//An object provides services:
