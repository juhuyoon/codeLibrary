//Putting data in order:
    //selection sort
    //Step 1: Work an Instance 
        //e.g.: 56, 17, 4, 33
        //putting the elements in order with selection sort!
    //Step 2: Write down what you did
        //starts as empty ArrayList(as long as in is not empty) [WHILE loops]
        //Find smallest element in (minElement) 
        //Remove minElement from in
        //Add minElement to out
        //Find smalelst element in (minElement)
        //Remove minElement from in
        //Add minElement to out
        //Find smallest element in (minElement)
        //Remove minElement from in
        //Add minElement to Out
        //out = answer

    //Note that selection sort is simple and slow on large data as its running time is quadratic in data size 
    //Two Categories in sorting algorithms:
        //Simple + slow: runtime quadratic in data size 
            //bubble and selection sorts are n^2 sorts, algorithms are easy to understand 
        //Clever + fast = runtime closer to linear in data size
            //quick sort, merge sort, etc. java.collections.sort (close to linear)
