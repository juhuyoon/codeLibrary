//Putting data in order:
    //selection sort
    //Step 1: Work an Instance 
        //e.g.: 56, 17, 4, 33
        //putting the elements in order with selection sort!
    //Step 2: Write down what you did
        //starts as empty ArrayList(as long as in is not empty) [WHILE loops]
        //Find smallest element in (minElement) 
        //Remove minElement from in
        //Add minElement to out
        //Find smalelst element in (minElement)
        //Remove minElement from in
        //Add minElement to out
        //Find smallest element in (minElement)
        //Remove minElement from in
        //Add minElement to Out
        //out = answer
