//Using string to store readable data
//Finding patterns and information via strings for the data

//e.g. Searching for genes with strings representing DNA
    //ATG = start codon
    //TAA = stop codon
    //Everything in between the codons are the DNA so...

    //1) Find a gene, Create a string  
    //2) Start looking after "ATG" until you find "TAA" (always look for both start and stop codons)
        //How do we find ATG in a string and how do we represent its position
    //3) Then take all the letters in between. (Note that it may not always be a string)
        //How do we get all the letters ina range?
