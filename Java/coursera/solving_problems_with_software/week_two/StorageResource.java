//Separation of Concerns
//e.g.
//To Print all Genes from a String
//1) Set startIndex to 0
//2) Repeat the following steps:
    //3) Find the next gene after startIndex
    //4) If no gene was found, leave this loop
    //5) Print the gene
    //6) Set startIndex to just past the end of the gene


// To Print High CG Genes from a String
    // 1) Set startIndex to 0
    // 2) Repeat the following steps:
        // 3) Find the next gene after startIndex
        // 4) If no gene was found, leave this loop
        // 5) If the gene has a high CG ratio, print it
        // 6) Set startIndex to just past the end of the gene

//Print Genes in HTML From a String
    // 1) Set startIndex to 0
    // 2) Repeat the following steps:
        // 3) Find the next gene after startIndex
        // 4) If no gene was found, leave this loop
        // 5) Print <li>, then the gene, then </li>
        // 6) Set startIndex to just past the end of the gene
